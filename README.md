# Analysis by Empirical Economics
Conducted an empirical analysis comparing debt indicators in Japan (developed country) and Mexico (developing country) to examine how debt impacts economic growth. 
Through the analysis of this time series, we tried to define how debt affects a country's economic growth.
The study explored relationships between debt levels, growth rates, and macroeconomic stability, highlighting key differences between the two economic contexts. 
Findings provided insights into sustainable debt thresholds and their implications for fiscal policy, offering guidance for policymakers in balancing growth and debt management strategies.
